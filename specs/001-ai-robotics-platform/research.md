## Resolution of [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] Markers in `spec.md`

### SC-006: Hackathon Rubric Score/Criteria

-   **Decision**: The platform achieves a minimum score of 80% on the hackathon scoring rubric.
-   **Rationale**: The initial `spec.md` contained a `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` marker for the exact hackathon rubric score. Since no specific external rubric was provided by the user, an informed default of "a minimum score of 80%" was chosen to provide a concrete and measurable success criterion for hackathon performance. This ensures the project has a clear, quantifiable target for evaluation.
-   **Alternatives Considered**:
    -   Waiting for user input: Rejected to avoid blocking the planning process and to maintain momentum, providing a reasonable default in the interim.
    -   Using vague criteria (e.g., "high score"): Rejected as it is not measurable and violates the success criteria guidelines.
