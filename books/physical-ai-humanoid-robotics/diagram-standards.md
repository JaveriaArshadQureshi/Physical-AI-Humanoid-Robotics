# Diagram and Visual Aid Standards for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

## General Guidelines

- All diagrams should be clear, scalable vector graphics (SVG preferred)
- Use consistent color schemes throughout the book
- Include detailed captions for all diagrams
- Maintain accessibility with appropriate contrast ratios

## Robot Representation

- Use standard symbols for different robot types
- Humanoid robots: Use consistent joint and link representation
- Coordinate frames: Use right-handed coordinate systems with X-red, Y-green, Z-blue convention
- Sensors: Use standard symbols (camera, LiDAR, IMU, etc.)

## Mathematical Diagrams

- Vectors: Use arrows with consistent styling
- Reference frames: Use labeled axes with consistent orientation
- Transformations: Show before/after states clearly

## Process Flow Diagrams

- Use standard flowchart symbols
- Direction: Generally left-to-right, top-to-bottom
- Colors: Use consistent color coding for different process types
- Connectors: Use clear directional arrows

## Software Architecture

- Components: Use rectangular boxes with clear labels
- Data flow: Use arrows showing direction of information
- Interfaces: Use standard symbols for API connections

## Color Standards

- Primary: #1f77b4 (blue)
- Secondary: #ff7f0e (orange)
- Success: #2ca02c (green)
- Warning: #d62728 (red)
- Neutral: #7f7f7f (gray)

## Font Standards

- Diagram labels: Sans-serif fonts (Arial, Helvetica)
- Minimum readable size: 12pt for printed, 14px for digital
- Consistent font sizes across similar elements

## File Organization

- Store diagrams in appropriate subdirectories under /diagrams/
- Use descriptive, consistent naming conventions
- Maintain both source files and rendered images when applicable
