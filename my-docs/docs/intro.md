# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on **Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics**. This book covers the essential concepts, techniques, and practical implementations needed to understand and develop humanoid robots using Physical AI principles.

## About This Book

This comprehensive resource covers the fundamentals and advanced topics in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. It is designed for robotics students, researchers, and engineers who want to build a strong foundation in this emerging field.

### What You'll Learn

- **Physical AI Fundamentals**: Understanding the paradigm shift from traditional AI to AI that interacts with the physical world
- **Robotics Foundations**: Linux, ROS2, simulation environments, and real robot control
- **Advanced Techniques**: SLAM, kinematics, control systems, perception, and machine learning
- **Implementation Skills**: Building, programming, and deploying humanoid robots
- **Safety and Ethics**: Critical considerations for human-robot interaction

### Target Audience

- Robotics students and researchers
- AI and robotics engineers
- Developers working on humanoid systems
- Anyone interested in the future of human-robot interaction

## Book Structure

The book is organized into progressive sections:

1. **Foundational Chapters**: Core concepts and setup
2. **Advanced Technical Chapters**: In-depth technical implementations
3. **Implementation and Specialized Topics**: Practical applications and project guidance

## Getting Started

To get the most out of this book:

1. Start with the foundational chapters to build a solid understanding
2. Progress sequentially through the chapters
3. Complete the exercises at the end of each chapter
4. Implement the code examples as you go
5. Work through the capstone project in the final chapter

### Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (Python and/or C++)
- Understanding of fundamental mathematics (linear algebra, calculus)
- Familiarity with robotics concepts (optional but helpful)

## Technical Setup

For practical exercises, you'll need:
- Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04 LTS
- ROS2 (Humble Hawksbill or later)
- Python 3.8+
- C++17 compiler
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim (for simulation chapters)
- Access to robot hardware (for implementation chapters)

### Code Examples

Code examples are provided in both Python and C++ to accommodate different preferences and use cases. You'll find practical implementations that reinforce the theoretical concepts covered in each chapter.

## Navigation

Use the sidebar to navigate through the chapters, or follow the sequential progression from foundational to advanced topics. Each chapter builds upon previous knowledge while providing practical examples and exercises.

Let's begin our journey into the fascinating world of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics!
